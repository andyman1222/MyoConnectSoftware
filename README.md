# MyoConnectSoftware
Repository for archiving the Myo Connect software, the official driver software for the Myo armband developed by Thalmic Labs, who became North before being shut down by Google.

I have made this repository for those who are looking for software installs, so they can obtain the latest (and last made) version of the official drivers. I have Myo Connect v1.01 installed, which is a newer version than anything I found on the internet, which will be attached as a release to this repo.

I say that what I have added here is the original, unmodified installer, however it is always safe practice to be weary of downloading anything from the internet. If you are unsure, feel free to scan with an antivirus locally or with online tools.

If you claim to have a more updated version of the software available, feel free to branch this repository with your updated variant, and I may look at it to see if it really is a newer version of the software. Same goes for other variants, like an Apple version.

This software is not of my own creation, and I do not hold any ownership rights; I am providing an otherwise widely inaccessible software as-is (do not contact me for bug reports or errors or such); it was developed by Thalmic Labs, dated back in 2014, but Thalmic Labs and the Myo brand as far as I can tell no longer exist after they transitioned to North, developing smartglasses, before being bought and entirely absorbed into Google (who has sat on and done nothing with the ex-smartglasses company since).
